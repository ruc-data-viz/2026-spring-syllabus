## Course Description

This is a one-semester introduction to data management and visualization techniques. While there will be a large focus on the visualization of data, data is rarely ever ready for that. This necessarily means that we also learn how to effectively transform our data. Further, visualization of data in the sciences requires an understanding of the types of data being visualized, the sensors or processes which collected the data, the dimensionality of the data, as well as the characteristics of the important information and any noise that may be present. These practical data visualization issues will also be covered. Depending on student interest, a number of special topics from industry and recent state of the art literature will be covered, including machine learning aided data visualization techniques (i.e., using machine learning to enhance visualizations) and visualizations of machine learning models and results.

### Prerequisite Knowledge

Students should be comfortable with basic computer programming concepts and with using digital systems in general. While students are not expected to be Python experts, they are expected to be able to pick up the necessary skills for this course. *This is a hands-on, coding heavy course*. Some machine learning will be covered, but background in machine learning is not required.

### Grading Policy

The semester will use the following grading scheme.

* 6 quizzes: 15%
* 6 homework assignments: 35%
* 1 midterm examination: 20%
* 1 final project: 20%
* Participation and professionalism: 10%

#### Participation and Professionalism

This course is designed to prepare students for professional data science roles. Professionalism is expected in all classroom interaction, student-student communication and collaboration, and instructor communication.

* Attendance and participation in class discussions is mandatory.
* Excused absence must be communicated in a professionally written email.
* Multiple unexcused absences will result in professionalism points deducted from final grade.
* Unexcused late assignments will be assigned a late penalty.

#### Final Grades

Letter grades are assigned as follows.

* `89.5 - 100.0` = `A`
* `86.5 - 89.49` = `B+`
* `79.5 - 86.49` = `B`
* `76.5 - 79.49` = `C+`
* `69.5 - 76.49` = `C`
* `59.5 - 69.49` = `D`
* `00.0 - 59.49` = `F`

#### Extra Credit

There will be a handful of opportunities for extra credit, potentially to include student research in special topics. Any point(s) awarded are applied directly to your final grade, up to a maximum of 4 points.

## Ethical Use of AI Technologies and Large Language Models

Large Language Models (LLMs), e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, etc., and other AI technologies are powerful tools that are accessible to all and used extensively in industry. While you are not prohibited from using these tools to enhance your learning experience and practice using AI assisted coding techniques, **you are strictly prohibited from using these tools to perform your work for you**.

This course is intended to teach *you* to extract original insights from data, with the goal of preparing *you* to be a productive member of a professional team, capable of bringing *original* insight to your teammates and stakeholders. An original insight is one that only *you* could have produced. While AI assisted coding techniques are used extensively in industry, productive and professional use of these tools requires you take the time to shape yourself into a craftsperson with sufficient knowledge and original insight to be worthy of the trust your teammates and stakeholders will place in you to ensure AI outputs are accurate, safe, and secure. AI tools cannot be fired, cannot be legally prosecuted, and feel no remorse for leaking private data, providing incorrect advice on critical issues, or burdening teams with technical debt and coding errors. The humans that use these tools, i.e., you, however are held accountable for the code you deploy and any positive, or negative, impacts therefrom.

Using these tools to complete assignments and/or assigned tasks is unproductive for learning and indicates a insufficient knowledge of the core material required to properly review the outputs of those AI tools for accuracy and safety, ultimately hindering student professional development. Understanding core material before applying AI to help expedite generation of tools and results is a key tenet of the ethical use of AI in industry and academia and more important now than ever to hiring managers. Why would a hiring manager hire you to join a team if you leave your academic journey unable to produce original insights that they couldn't have prompted an AI tool to obtain with you, and unable to review AI outputs for correctness?

As an introductory course geared to teach *you* new skills, this course has a strict zero tolerance policy for use of AI generated code.

Discussing course topics with AI tools or using AI to generate examples to facilitate learning is allowed, however, **all of the following instances of unprofessional or irresponsible conduct will result in a zero without exception**.

* Direct copy and paste of AI code. This prevents you from learning how to apply the underlying techniques.
* Using the same exact code as another student (because you both copied from the same AI model). Copying your work off another machine intelligence is the same as copying your work off a human intelligence.
* Blind application of AI to a problem and use of results therefrom without researching and citing prior work around that problem. (See the following section on academic integrity.)
* Generation of AI slop. We will review examples of AI slop and discuss as a class why it is unprofessional, and ultimately harmful to technical teams, and the users of our products or stakeholders who trust our technical reports.

Note that even if using AI within the acceptable limits, even leading foundation models often get problems studied in this class wrong, and do not always write correct code! **You are responsible for the code you turn in, and you will ultimately get the grade assigned, not the AI tool.** AI is trained to satisfy human reviewers (who often are not experts) that it is correct, not to actually *be* correct, which leads to AI models having a tendency to be confidently wrong. The AI models are not motivated to help you get the answer to your homework problem right, only to **convince** you they are right, which makes using AI tools in a domain you are still learning dangerous.

It is important to note that in industry, outside the context of this course, AI is used extensively, but responsible employers have adopted AI standards of practices and established internal AI governance boards to ensure its proper use, and will only hire employees with sufficient knowledge of their own to be capable of reviewing the outputs of AI tools to prevent reputational or societal harm.

For examples of the harm that misuse of AI can cause to society, consult the [AI Incident Database](https://incidentdatabase.ai/).

## University Policies on Academic Integrity

Principles of academic integrity require that every Rutgers University student:

* properly acknowledge and cite all use of the ideas, results, or words of others
* properly acknowledge all contributors to a given piece of work
* make sure that all work submitted as his or her own in a course or other academic activity is produced without the aid of unsanctioned materials or unsanctioned collaboration
* obtain all data or results by ethical means and report them accurately without suppressing any results inconsistent with his or her * interpretation or conclusions
* treat all other students in an ethical manner, respecting their integrity and right to pursue their educational goals without interference. This requires that a student neither facilitate academic dishonesty by others nor obstruct their academic progress
* uphold the canons of the ethical or professional code of the profession for which he or she is preparing.

Adherence to these principles is necessary in order to insure that:

* everyone is given proper credit for his or her ideas, words, results, and other scholarly accomplishments
* all student work is fairly evaluated and no student has an inappropriate advantage over others
* the academic and ethical development of all students is fostered
* the reputation of the University for integrity in its teaching, research, and scholarship is maintained and enhanced.

Failure to uphold these principles of academic integrity threatens both the reputation of the University and the value of the degrees awarded to its students. Every member of the University community therefore bears a responsibility for ensuring that the highest standards of academic integrity are upheld.

Infractions are not taken lightly and will fully be pursued. For additional information, visit [http://academicintegrity.rutgers.edu/](http://academicintegrity.rutgers.edu/)
